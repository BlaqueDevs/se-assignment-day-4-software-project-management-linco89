# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

It ensures to keep the project on schedule and avoid additional/over costs.
It also enhances investors trust and relationship.

Deadlines can be met by:

Calling for a weekly meeting to give report.

Assigning tasks to various individuals.

Monitoring the ongoing project frequently.


## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

It helps by preventing budget overrun and ensures that all the resources are allocated accordingly for the project development.

Some of the strategies that can be used to prevent budget overrun are:

Estimate the cost of resources meeded.

Make  a budget plan and allocate the resources accordingly.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile methodology allows flexibility in project development. It gives room for team members to work simultaneously on different aspect of the project, and carries an iterative approach. It also allows regular customer feedback and quick responses. 

But agile methodology is less predictable and requires significant customer involvement.


Waterfall Methodology takes a linear approach. It requires easch stage of the project to be completed before advancing to the next stage.  It is easy to manage and has a clear structure, but it does not easily accomodate changes.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is best for projects with changing requirements such as mobile app, product design marketing campaign.

Waterfall is beat for projects with defined requirements. Examples are construction project, large-scale projects and industries


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Ensuring quality assurance (QA) in a software project involves methods such as clear requirements analysis, comprehensive test planning, and automated testing. Regular code reviews, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and test-driven development (TDD) help catch and address issues early. Performance and security testing are crucial to verify the system’s capabilities and protect against vulnerabilities. User acceptance testing (UAT) ensures the software meets end-user needs before release. 

High standards in QA are important for achieving user satisfaction, reducing costs, minimizing risks, and maintaining a strong reputation. By focusing on these practices, organizations can deliver reliable, secure, and effective software.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
